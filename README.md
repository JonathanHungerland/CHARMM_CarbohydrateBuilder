# CHARMM_CarbohydrateBuilder
This is a collection of scripts to construct randomly orientied and structured systems
of polymer structures. It produces pdb/psf files that are needed for Molecular Dynamics
simulations. Currently, it is only implemented for constructing the Methanochondroitin
polymer but it can also be used for other carbohydrates after indlucing the necessary
source files and some alterations to 01_polymer_generation.tcl .
