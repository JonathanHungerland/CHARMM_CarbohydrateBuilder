#Goal of this script: Construct two randomly oriented Methanochondroitin polymers
#inside a box of ionized water.

#Here are the settings:
set build_method "angry_baby" ;#will randomly throw the polymers around until they don't clash
set space_per_polymer "12.0" ;#the box in which angry_baby throws. it will be a cube of side length
                              #space_per_polymer*number_of_polymers. the latter is read automatically 
                              #once all polymers have been built
set temperature 300 ;#simulation temperature, only relevant to get salt concentration perfectly right.
set water_padding 20 ;#how much distance in angstrÃ¶m there is to the edge of the water box.
set cation "SOD" ;#the cation for ionization
set anion "CLA" ;#the anion for ionization 
set salt_concentration "0.15" ;#salt concentration in mol/L. 0.00 is a valid entry if you don't want salts.

#import all scripts that you need. will also set default values for all parameters that have not been given yet.
